### Evaluation of Sources

Several sources have been standing out in usefulness to my project.
They are evaluated to a special extent, as I have spent the most time looking
at information in them.

#### Stackoverflow and the Stack Exchange network

Stackoverflow the biggest Question and Answer forum of the topic of programming.
It is well respected by many programming communities for its high-quality content.

For me, it has answered many questions about JavaScript, Node.js, and other technologies
quickly.

#### The Mozilla Developer Network

The MDN is a collaboratively created collection of pages (a wiki) about the topic of Web Development.
It includes many useful articles about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other web technologies.

The fact that is is collaboratively managed by a large community makes it reliable.

#### The Node.js Reference

The official documentation of Node.js has proven to be very useful to my project.
It documents the core APIs of Node.js.

The Node.js docs are a rendered version of the markdown files in the GitHub repository,
which makes them reliable, as anyone can submit a pull request, which will be reviewed.

--------

#### The AngularJS Reference

AngularJS is the powerful framework powering the Branches frontend.

It is a very well-organized framework, which is a major player in frameworks for 
web applications (like Backbone, Ember, React).

The API documentation is very extensive, well-written, and also well-designed.
Angular also has a useful guide, which helped me get started quickly a few months ago.

As the documentation is very frequently accessed, and managed by the community, it is reliable,

#### The Express Reference

Express is the Node.js web framework, on which Branches is built. It is lightweight (compared to 
Rails and similar), but its features make creating web applications in Node.js possible faster by
minimizing reinvention of features. It is based on Connect (version 3, 4 not anymore, but compatible),
a middleware-layer, which makes it compatible with many extensions, e.g. cookie sessins, Redis storage,
static file development servers, templating needed for web apps.

I am not sure who manages the Express documentation, but it has been very reliable. The fact that Express
is a small, lightweight and well-organized framework makes it very simple to look at the source directly
and not use the documentation.

#### The Mongoose Reference

The Model layer of Branches is based on Mongoose.
It provides a very intuitive way of creating data models, which is superior
to the badly-documented and complex MongoDB module.

The documentation is very helpful and well-organized. It provides effective examples,
and it is hosted in the project's GitHub repository, allowing everyone to contribute, and making
it reliable.
