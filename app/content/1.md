## Aims, and the Project

### Choice of Topic

The chosen topic of interest is _social networking and web technoligies_.

branches.io, the main product is a social network, explaining the topic of social networking.
It uses parts of the traditional concepts of social networking used by big
social networks, and combines them with new ideas and lesser-known ideas.

The application is built on top of very modern frontend and backend web technologies utilizing
modern standards of the browser while maintaining necessary backwards-compability
and flexibility to meet the demands of all clients.
The API and web application is powered by a Node.js backend with a flexible and
fast MongoDB database.

### Areas of Interaction

The project is fully centered around creation of services, which enable clients the
creation of content.
This fits the area of interaction _Human Ingenuity_ very strongly.

The Branches Network also has features of _Health and Social Interaction_,
by focusing on the users' interactions, however, needing to focus on one, I believe that
_Human Ingenuity_ is the better fit.

### The Goal
  
At the beginning, my goal was defined as

_Create a successful and reliable Social Network on self-setup server infrastructure with the potential of making advertising profits._
